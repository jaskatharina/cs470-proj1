This project compares and contrasts two priority queues, the fibonacci heap and the pairing heap, in the context of their implementation in Prim's and Dijkstra's algorithms.

Dijkstra's:
    To compile: g++ Dijkstra.cpp -o Dijkstra.exe
    To run: ./Dijkstra.exe

Prim's:
    To compile: g++ Prim.cpp -o Prim.exe
    To run: ./Prim.exe

After running both Prim's and Dijkstra's at least once:
    Generate comparative plots: python3 plot.py
